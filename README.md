# Closet App

Welcome to my Phase 5 Portfolio Project for Flatiron School. The App is designed to track "inventory" and provide a visual representation of a user's closet. React and Redux are utilized on the frontend with a Rails API on the backend. 

To test the app, please run your rails server on port 4000.
